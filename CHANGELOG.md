Bug fixes, documentation, and quality improvements based on public review feedback.

### Fixed

- **FID → INP**: Replaced deprecated First Input Delay with Interaction to Next Paint in deployment.md (thresholds updated to <200ms / >500ms)
- **Accordion anti-pattern**: Replaced `max-height: 500px` hack with modern `grid-template-rows: 0fr → 1fr` pattern in motion-designer.md
- **Type scale mislabel**: Corrected "1.25 ratio" to "Tailwind defaults" in ui-designer.md and brand-kit.md, added clarifying note
- **SOURCE_WIDTH undeclared**: Added variable declaration in ab-variants.md figma_execute block
- **Hardcoded project names**: Replaced 'Feed'/'Saved'/'Discover' with generic nav-hiding heuristic in figma-responsive.md
- **Eval #4 broken path**: Fixed fixture reference to `./evals/fixtures/test-page.html` and created the fixture file
- **Eval #11 missing assertion**: Added `has-speaker-notes` assertion to design-presentation eval

### Added

- **MCP-SETUP.md**: Complete guide for 4 optional MCP servers — Figma REST, Desktop Bridge, Claude Preview, Playwright — with install instructions, verification steps, and "Working Without MCP" table

### Changed
