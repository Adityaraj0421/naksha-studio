**Version-agnostic assets:**
- Removed version badge from `assets/social-preview.svg` — design is now evergreen
- Updated stale stat numbers in social preview to current values with `+` notation (26+ roles, 57+ commands, 13,500+ lines, 7 agents)
- Removed `v3.5.0` text from `demos/demo.svg` — replaced with `naksha-studio` wordmark

**New command:**
- `/naksha-help` — contextual quick-reference: browse all 11 categories, list per-category commands, or get a reference card for any specific command (58th command)

**Wiring:**
- `naksha-help` added to SKILL.md trigger phrases and command table
- `naksha-help` added to Stop hook suggestions

## v4.3.0 — Agent Upgrades (2026-03-17)

**New agents:**
- `design-token-extractor` — reads CSS/SCSS/Tailwind configs, extracts and categorizes design tokens, outputs CSS vars/Tailwind/Style Dictionary. Reads `.naksha/project.json` for preferred format.
- `design-critic` — 3-pass UX critique: Pass 1 Nielsen's 10 heuristics (severity-rated), Pass 2 accessibility spot-check, Pass 3 content quality (microcopy, errors, tone, hierarchy). Playwright-enabled for live URLs. Reads `.naksha/` brand voice.

**Upgraded agents:**
- `accessibility-auditor` — Playwright URL capture (live site auditing), `.naksha/` brand color contrast awareness, WCAG 2.2 new criteria (2.5.7, 2.5.8, 3.2.6, 3.3.7)
- `design-qa` — Playwright viewport simulation (375/768/1280px breakpoints), `.naksha/` token format + framework context, Tailwind arbitrary value detection

**Stats:** 7 agents (+2) · 57 commands · 26 roles

## v4.2.0 — Eval Quality & CI Hardening (2026-03-17)

**Eval quality:**
- Upgraded v4.1.0 tutorial evals (IDs 140–145) from shallow keyword checks to rich 6-assertion format
- All 146 evals now follow consistent named-assertion pattern

**CI hardening — 3 new validate-structure checks (5 → 8):**
- Check 6: `pipeline-yaml-structure` — validates all pipeline YAML files have name, description, steps, and command fields
- Check 7: `skill-command-sync` — ensures every command in `commands/` is referenced in `skills/design/SKILL.md`
- Check 8: `command-allowed-tools` — enforces `allowed-tools:` frontmatter on all 57 command files; fixed 17 commands that were missing it
- Updated stale comment in Check 4 (previously said "17/46 commands lack allowed-tools" — now all 57 are compliant)

## v4.1.0 — Tutorial Depth & Pipeline Library (2026-03-17)

**Tutorial expansion:**
- 3 new tutorial tracks: `conversational` (chatbot → VUI → pipeline), `spatial` (visionOS → AR → competitive audit), `compliance` (GDPR → HIPAA → project memory)
- `full` track expanded 16 → 19 steps (chatbot, GDPR, and /pipeline run launch-prep added)
- Welcome Screen updated with tracks 10–12 and Frontier Wings / Memory & Pipelines rows
- Footer tracks list updated with all 12 tracks

**Pipeline library:**
- 3 new built-in pipelines: `design-tokens` (design-system → brand-kit → design-framework), `email-launch` (email-template → email-campaign → email-audit), `ar-prototype` (design-spatial → design-ar-overlay → competitive-audit)
- Total: 7 pipelines in `skills/design/pipelines/`

## v4.0.0 (2026-03-17)

The biggest naksha release — four pillars that transform the plugin from a stateless command toolkit into a project-aware, vision-capable, pipeline-driven design operations platform with three new frontier wings.

CI/CD Design Checks — GitHub Action that runs design linting on every PR touching HTML/CSS.

### Added

- **`.github/workflows/design-check.yml`**: GitHub Actions workflow triggers on PRs modifying HTML/CSS/SCSS. Runs design lint, posts score badge + issue table as PR comment (updates on re-run), fails CI if score is below threshold.

- **`scripts/design-lint.js`**: Portable Node.js linter. Works in CI (`CHANGED_FILES` env var) and locally (`node scripts/design-lint.js <files>`). 10 checks: HTML lang, img alt, semantic HTML, button-vs-div, viewport meta, form labels, hardcoded hex colors, fixed pixel widths, inline styles, missing breakpoints. Outputs `design-lint-report.json` with score (0–100), issue list, pass/fail/warning counts. Score = 100 − (errors × 10) − (warnings × 3). Default fail threshold: 70.
- **`.design-lint.json.example`**: Configuration reference — `failThreshold`, check toggles, `ignorePatterns` for dist/vendor files.
