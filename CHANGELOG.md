# Changelog

All notable changes to naksha are documented here.

## v4.7.0 — Design Intelligence (2026-03-17)

**`/design-score` command (60th command):**
- Quantitative 0–100 score across 4 dimensions: Accessibility (25pts), Usability (25pts), Visual Quality (25pts), Token Compliance (25pts)
- Grade scale: A (90–100 production ready) → F (<60 requires redesign)
- Inputs: URL (Playwright), local file, `--screenshot <path>`, or Figma node ID
- Output: `╔ Design Score ╗` card with ASCII progress bars per dimension, grade, top-5 issues sorted by impact, per-dimension breakdown, score methodology footer
- Reads `.naksha/project.json` for brand token context in Token Compliance scoring

**`design-critic` agent upgraded (170 → 227 lines):**
- Added **Scoring Calculation** step — derives all 4 dimension scores from pass findings before writing the final output
- Added **Pass 4: Token Compliance** — scans for hardcoded color/typography/spacing values vs. token system; 5 sub-criteria × 5pts each; fallback to visual consistency when no token system present
- Final output now opens with `━━━ Design Score Summary ━━━` block: overall score, per-dimension bars, grade
- Updated `━━━ Overall Assessment ━━━` to include Usability Y/25, Visual Quality, and Token Compliance (replaces old "Heuristics Score: X/30")
- Scoring model is identical to `/design-score` — critic and score outputs are directly comparable

**Evals (IDs 157–160, total: 161):**
- ID 157: `design-score-landing-page` — URL input, 6 assertions
- ID 158: `design-score-screenshot-mode` — screenshot input, code-inspection limits noted, 5 assertions
- ID 159: `design-critic-produces-score-summary` — upgrade validation, 6 assertions
- ID 160: `design-critic-token-compliance-pass` — Pass 4 presence + token guidance, 5 assertions

## v4.6.0 — CI/CD & Community Health (2026-03-17)

**CI/CD:**
- New workflow `quality-check.yml`: runs behavioral-smoke + guard-legacy-branding on PRs touching fixtures, commands, or CI scripts — posts collapsible failure details as PR comment
- CI coverage now: validate-structure (structural), quality-check (behavioral + branding), design-check (CSS/HTML) — three orthogonal workflows

**`/naksha-doctor` command (59th command):**
- Runs all 4 quality scripts (validate-structure, verify-metadata, behavioral-smoke, guard-legacy-branding) and produces a `╔ naksha doctor ╗` health report
- `--fix` flag adds per-check remediation instructions for every failure type
- Added to SKILL.md routing ("doctor", "health check", "validate plugin", "diagnose naksha") and Stop hook suggestions

**Community health:**
- `.github/labels.yml`: 17 canonical label definitions (Triage, Workflow, Area groups)
- `scripts/sync-labels.sh`: idempotent label sync via `gh label create/edit`
- Created labels: `wishlist`, `claimed`, `ci`, `commands`, `agents`, `knowledge`, `evals`, `wing`
- `CONTRIBUTING.md`: added `## Building a Wing` — 7-step wing checklist (role reference → commands → SKILL.md → evals → fixtures → platform adapters → stats), PR requirements, examples from 3 existing wings

Detects 7 common anti-patterns (wall of text, button soup, icon ambiguity, etc.). Produces per-principle score table.

Runs design lint, posts score badge + issue table as PR comment (updates on re-run), fails CI if score is below threshold. Changed files passed via `CHANGED_FILES` env var (not shell interpolation) to prevent command injection.
- **`scripts/design-lint.js`**: Portable Node.js linter. Works in CI (`CHANGED_FILES` env var) and locally (`node scripts/design-lint.js <files>`). 10 checks: HTML lang, img alt, semantic HTML, button-vs-div, viewport meta, form labels, hardcoded hex colors, fixed pixel widths, inline styles, missing breakpoints. Outputs `design-lint-report.json` with score (0–100), issue list, pass/fail/warning counts. Score = 100 − (errors × 10) − (warnings × 3). Default fail threshold: 70.
