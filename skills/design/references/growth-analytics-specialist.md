## KPI Frameworks

### Metrics by Campaign Objective

| Objective | Primary KPIs | Secondary KPIs | Vanity (track, don't optimize) |
|-----------|-------------|----------------|-------------------------------|
| **Awareness** | Reach, impressions, video views | Profile visits, follower growth rate | Likes |
| **Engagement** | Engagement rate, saves, shares | Comments, story replies, DM conversations | Total followers |
| **Traffic** | Link clicks, CTR, landing page sessions | Bounce rate, time on page, pages/session | Impressions |
| **Conversion** | Signups, purchases, leads generated | Cost per acquisition, conversion rate | Click volume |
| **Retention** | Repeat engagement rate, UGC volume | Brand mention sentiment, community growth | Total reach |
| **Community** | Active members, discussion threads | Member retention rate, referral rate | Member count |

### Engagement Rate Formulas

Each platform calculates engagement differently. Use the correct formula:

| Platform | Formula | Good Benchmark |
|----------|---------|---------------|
| Instagram | (likes + comments + saves + shares) / reach x 100 | 3-6% |
| TikTok | (likes + comments + shares) / views x 100 | 4-8% |
| LinkedIn | (reactions + comments + shares) / impressions x 100 | 2-5% |
| Twitter/X | (likes + retweets + replies + link clicks) / impressions x 100 | 1-3% |
| YouTube | (likes + comments) / views x 100 | 3-7% |
| Facebook | (reactions + comments + shares) / reach x 100 | 1-3% |

**Note**: "Engagement rate by reach" is more accurate than "by followers" — not all followers see every post.

```

### KPI Card Component Pattern

```html
<div class="kpi-card">
  <span class="kpi-label">Engagement Rate</span>
  <span class="kpi-value">4.2%</span>
  <span class="kpi-trend positive">↑ 0.8% vs last period</span>
  <div class="kpi-sparkline"><!-- 30-day mini chart --></div>
</div>
```

Styles: Use brand primary for positive trends, semantic red for negative, neutral gray for flat. Sparkline uses Chart.js with `type: 'line'`, no axes, just the line.

### Chart Library

Use **Chart.js** for dashboard visualizations:
- Line chart: engagement/reach trends over time
- Bar chart: platform comparison, content type comparison
- Doughnut chart: traffic source breakdown
- Table: top/bottom performing posts with sortable columns

## A/B Testing for Social

### What to Test (Priority Order)

1. **Creative format** — Image vs carousel vs video vs text-only
2. **Hook / headline** — Different opening lines for same content
3. **CTA text** — "Learn more" vs "Get the guide" vs "DM me [keyword]"
4. **Posting time** — Morning vs afternoon vs evening
5. **Hashtag sets** — Broad-heavy vs niche-heavy vs minimal
6. **Audience targeting** — Different segments for paid social

### Test Design Template

```
Experiment: [Name]
Hypothesis: Changing [variable] from [A] to [B] will increase
            [metric] by [target %].

Control (A): [Describe current version]
Variant (B): [Describe changed version]

Platform: [Where the test runs]
Duration: Minimum 7 days (to capture weekday + weekend behavior)
Sample: Minimum 1,000 impressions per variant
Success metric: [Primary KPI to compare]
Guardrail metric: [Secondary KPI that must not degrade]
Significance: 95% confidence level

Decision:
  - If B > A by [target %] at 95% confidence → adopt B
  - If B < A or inconclusive → keep A, test next variable
```

### Sample Size Quick Reference

| Baseline Rate | 10% Lift Detectable | 20% Lift Detectable |
|--------------|--------------------|--------------------|
| 1% CTR | ~15,000/variant | ~4,000/variant |
| 3% engagement | ~5,000/variant | ~1,300/variant |
| 5% engagement | ~3,000/variant | ~800/variant |
| 10% conversion | ~1,500/variant | ~400/variant |

Based on 80% power, 95% significance. Lower baseline rates need more data.

## Conversion Tracking

### UTM Parameter Framework

```
https://example.com/landing-page
  ?utm_source=[platform]
  &utm_medium=[content-type]
  &utm_campaign=[campaign-name]
  &utm_content=[creative-variant]
  &utm_term=[targeting-segment]
```

### UTM Naming Convention

| Parameter | Format | Examples |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| utm_source | Platform name, lowercase | `instagram`, `linkedin`, `tiktok`, `twitter` |
| utm_medium | Content type, lowercase | `feed-post`, `story`, `reel`, `carousel`, `ad` |
| utm_campaign | Campaign name, kebab-case | `q2-product-launch`, `brand-awareness-mar26` |
| utm_content | Variant label | `hook-a`, `hook-b`, `carousel-v1`, `video-testimonial` |
| utm_term | Target segment (paid only) | `lookalike-buyers`, `interest-design`, `retarget-30d` |

**Rules**:
- Always lowercase, use hyphens not spaces or underscores
- Include UTMs on every link shared via social (bio links, story links, ad links)
- Keep campaign names consistent across platforms for cross-platform attribution

### Platform Pixel/Event Tracking

| Platform | Tracking Tool | Key Events |
|----------|--------------|------------|
| Meta (IG/FB) | Meta Pixel | PageView, Lead, Purchase, AddToCart |
| LinkedIn | Insight Tag | PageView, Conversion (custom) |
| TikTok | TikTok Pixel | PageView, CompleteRegistration, Purchase |
| Twitter/X | Twitter Pixel | PageView, Signup, Purchase |
| Google Analytics 4 | GA4 tag | All UTM-tagged traffic, custom events |

## Funnel Design

### Social-to-Conversion Funnel

```
TOFU — Awareness
│  Metrics: Reach, impressions, video views
│  Content: Educational posts, entertaining reels, trend content
│
├──► MOFU — Consideration
│    Metrics: Profile visits, saves, shares, link clicks
│    Content: Case studies, how-tos, testimonials, carousels
│
├──────► BOFU — Conversion
│        Metrics: Landing page visits, signups, purchases
│        Content: Product demos, offers, DM automation, social proof
│
└──────────► RETENTION
             Metrics: Repeat engagement, UGC, advocacy
             Content: Community posts, exclusive content, user stories
```

### Drop-off Analysis

At each funnel stage, identify where users leave:

| Transition | Healthy Rate | Red Flag Below | Fix |
|-----------|-------------|---------------|-----|
| Impression → Engagement | 3-8% | < 1% | Improve hooks, creative quality |
| Engagement → Profile Visit | 5-15% | < 2% | Stronger CTAs, clearer value prop |
| Profile Visit → Link Click | 10-25% | < 5% | Optimize bio, improve link-in-bio page |
| Link Click → Conversion | 2-10% | < 1% | Landing page alignment, offer clarity |

## Reference-Sourced Insights

### The Single Most Important Growth Question (From Reforge / Brian Balfour)

- Ask five people at your company to whiteboard the answer to "How does your product grow?" If you get five different answers — or answers that represent only one piece of the picture — your team cannot have aligned conversations about priorities, metrics, or strategy. Misaligned growth models lead directly to teams moving in opposite directions.
- This is not a metrics problem; it is a shared mental model problem. Before establishing KPIs, ensure every stakeholder can diagram the same growth system. A growth loop diagram (see below) is the most efficient tool for aligning this understanding.

### Growth Loops vs. Funnels: The Fundamental Framework Shift (From Reforge / Brian Balfour)

- **Funnels** (AARRR — Pirate Metrics, coined by Dave McClure, 2007) are a useful micro-view of individual steps but fail at the company level because: (1) they create strategic silos between product, acquisition, and monetization; (2) they create functional silos between teams that optimize at each other's expense; (3) they operate in one direction — no compounding effect, just more input required to maintain the same output.
- **Growth Loops** are closed systems: the output of one cycle is reinvested as input for the next cycle, creating compounding growth. A loop answers the question "How does one cohort of users lead to another cohort of users?" — funnels cannot.
- Pinterest's core growth loop: User signs up → Pinterest activates them with relevant content → User saves/repins content → Pinterest distributes quality content to search engines → New users find content via search → Sign up or return. Each cycle produces users who produce content that generates more users — compound, not linear.
- The fastest-growing products are typically powered by **1-2 major loops** that transition over time. Multiple low-powered loops are a symptom of unfocused growth strategy, not a sign of sophistication.

### Loops vs. Tactics: The Defensibility Dimension (From Reforge / Brian Balfour)

- Tactics and strategies that aren't specific to your product, users, and monetization model can be replicated by competitors — and as they get copied, effectiveness trends to zero. Growth loops are inherently product-specific (they combine your unique product behavior, channel, and monetization in one system), making them harder to replicate.
- Investment decision framework derived from loops: choose the initiative that generates compounding results over the one that generates a larger short-term spike. Initiative B (20 new users in week 1, growing 10% WoW) beats Initiative A (500 users this week, nothing after) on a 6-month horizon. Always evaluate growth investments against the compounding curve, not the first-week output.

### Why Funnel-Based Team Structure Creates Measurement Problems (From Reforge / Brian Balfour)

- Structuring teams by funnel layers — Marketing owns acquisition, Product owns retention, Sales owns revenue — creates teams that optimize metrics at the expense of each other. Marketing fills top-of-funnel with low-quality users to hit acquisition goals; retention tanks. The fix isn't more checks and balances; it's reorganizing teams around the loop output, not the funnel layer.
- Loop-organized teams cross functional lines — they need product, data, engineering, and design working toward the same goal: the output of the loop. This eliminates the "optimizing at others' expense" failure mode because all functions are measured against the same shared output.

### Translating Loops to Quantitative Models (From Reforge / Brian Balfour)

- A growth loop diagram is a qualitative tool — it changes how you think, not how you measure. To make it actionable, translate the loop into a quantitative growth model: identify each step in the loop, assign a conversion rate to each step, and model how changes to individual conversion rates affect the loop's overall output over time.
- This quantitative model is what enables: communicating priorities to leadership, making strategic bets, setting goals tied to specific loop steps, and building a metrics roadmap. The loop is the structure; the quantitative model is the measurement instrument.
- Key insight: improving the weakest step in a loop (the lowest conversion rate) produces disproportionately more output than improving an already-strong step. A growth metrics roadmap should always identify the constraining step in the primary loop.

### Product-Channel-Monetization Fit: The Three-Way Integration Requirement (From Reforge / Brian Balfour)

- Product strategy and acquisition channel strategy cannot be designed in silos. **Product-Channel Fit** (Brian Balfour): the channels control their own rules — products must be molded to fit channel behavior, not the reverse. A product designed without channel fit will fail on distribution regardless of product quality.
- **Channel-Model Fit**: monetization model enables or disables certain acquisition channels. A product with high LTV per customer can afford paid acquisition; a product with near-zero per-user monetization cannot. Monetization decisions made without considering channel implications constrain growth options before a single campaign launches.
- Practical implication for analytics: when measuring channel performance, evaluate channels not just on CAC and volume but on whether the channel's user quality is compatible with the product's growth loop. A channel that drives high-volume but low-engagement users may break the loop even if it appears efficient at acquisition.

### The Lifecycle of a Growth Tactic (From Reforge / Brian Balfour)

- All tactics become less effective over time as more organizations adopt them. Early-mover advantage on a tactic is real but temporary. Teams that rely primarily on tactics must constantly invent new ones — not sustainable. Teams that rely on growth loops (which are product-specific) are less exposed to tactic saturation.
- Measurement implication: when a previously effective channel or tactic shows declining efficiency over multiple reporting periods, the default hypothesis should be tactic saturation, not execution failure. The correct response is loop-level strategic review, not optimization of the decaying tactic.
